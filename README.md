<h1 align="center">To-Do List Web App</h1>
This is a simple yet functional To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. One of the key features is that the to-do list persists even after refreshing the page, thanks to the use of localStorage for storing the tasks.
